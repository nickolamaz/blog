Where there is Kubernetes, there is Kubecost: we can’t wait to reunite (or meet for the first time!) with thousands of users and future users in Los Angeles from October 13–15, 2021 for [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/): CNCF’s flagship conference.

It’s hard to imagine that two years ago, our then-tiny team was meeting for the first time at the last in-person KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in 2019, building features in real-time at our minimalist booth and extolling the virtues of Kubernetes cost monitoring to hundreds of engineers. What a difference two years makes: Kubecost is proud to be a Gold sponsor of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon this year, and we’re bringing a team of 15 of our best and brightest, eager to talk all things Kubernetes, answer your most challenging product questions, and tell you more about our company and products. 

We’re looking forward to meeting all of you at our booth (**G9**, to be precise)—and of course, we’ll have plenty of swag and lots of surprises in store!

## Demo exclusive soon-to-be-released features 

We’ve got a lot to show off, from our core open-source cost monitoring, management, and savings tools, to exclusive previews of cutting-edge technology coming in future versions of Kubecost, like:

* One-click automated implementation of spot (preemptible) nodes

* Reserved instance recommendations

* GPU usage monitoring and cost efficiency

* Assets in [kubectl cost](https://github.com/kubecost/kubectl-cost)

* Improved alerts UI
